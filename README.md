# Who am I?

I’m a B.Tech IT student focused on cloud infrastructure, networking, and security, with hands-on experience in Linux and Python. I use GitHub to publish tools, experiments, and practical implementations while building skills for cloud-focused infrastructure and security roles.

## Technical Background

- **Cloud & AWS & GCP**: Deployment and management of infrastructure on AWS, including EC2, S3, IAM, and VPC design.  
- **Network Setup & LAN Configuration**: Home and lab network design, IP addressing, VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and basic routing.  
- **Router Configuration & Segmentation**: LAN isolation, DHCP reservations, network segmentation, and firewall/ACL configuration.  
- **Linux Systems**: Installation, maintenance, and daily use on desktop and server setups, including headless servers.  
- **Linux Networking & Services**: SSH hardening, Nginx, DHCP, UFW firewall configuration, and network monitoring in lab environments.  
- **Python Programming**: Scripting for automation, infrastructure tasks, and minor open-source contributions.  
- **Virtual Machines & Home Labs**: Using VMs and physical servers for testing, networking experiments, and cloud-style setups.  
- **Docker & CI/CD**: Local container orchestration, image management, and basic CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
